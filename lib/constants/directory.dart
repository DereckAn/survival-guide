    Canvas is the most important website you'll be using in your school career here because that'll be where you submit assignments, get graded, and find the syllabus, amongst other things. If you are looking at this page, you are using Canvas right now! There are a few main functions that you can use Canvas for:

    dashboard.png Dashboard. This is the default view that you see when you first log onto Canvas with. You can use the Dashboard to see all of your classes. You can use the three dots in the corner to change the primary dashboard view between card, list, and recent activity views. 
    courses.png Courses. This will list the courses you are currently enlisted in and let you go to that course's homepage. 
    calendar.png Calendar. With the Calendar view, you can see all your assignments and other notifications from canvas for a specific view type. The Default view is on month, but you can select weekly and daily views as well. Please note that it is tempting to only rely on the calendar for assignments. This is a mistake.
